# [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/)
## Traverse a tree
Goal:
- Understand the difference between different tree traversal methods;
- Be able to solve preorder, inorder and postorder traversal recursively;
- Be able to solve preorder, inorder and postorder traversal iteratively;
- Be able to do level traversal using BFS.
### Introduction
- Pre-order traversal
ROOT-L-R
- In-order traversal
L-ROOT-R Binary search tree
- Post-order traversal
L-R-ROOT 
Note that deletion is Post-order,also it is widely used in mathmaticalexpression.
- Recursive or Iterative 递归或者迭代
